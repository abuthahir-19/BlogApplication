# MetaBlog 

This is my very first front-end project using TypeScript through this project I learned a lot of stuff in using TypeScript with React development and also used Reat Router for routing between different pages of the blog application it also provides a search feature which enhances the user experience for searching between the blogs they intended to visit. The blog post in this project have taken from the rapid API's free subscription and I have altered the default response of the api by storing it in the local json like files to accurately display the content based on the design. This project also have the ability to switch between the dark or light mode based on the need of the end-user.
